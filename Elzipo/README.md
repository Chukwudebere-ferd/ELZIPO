## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

- **Clone the Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Chukwudebere-ferd/ELZIPO.git
  cd ELZIPO
  ```
- **Install Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- **Run the Development Server**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start the Vite development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Variables

This project uses Firebase and Cloudinary. For local development create a `.env.local` file (see `.env.example`) and add your Firebase config and Cloudinary values.

For production (Vercel) you'll need to add the same variables as **Environment Variables** in your Vercel project or use the included helper `./scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh .env.production` to add them as Vercel secrets and map them into your project. See `SETUP_VERCEL.md` for details.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

The application will display the main portfolio page. You can navigate through the different sections (Projects, About, Contact) using the sidebar navigation links. The hero section introduces the portfolio, while the social icons and technology stack showcase provide additional insights into the developer's capabilities.
